# Business-scenario-financial-model
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing business performance using a **scenario-based sales and margin model** built in Excel.
It evaluates how changes in sales volume impact revenue, costs, and gross margin across different business situations.
The model compares **Best Case, Realistic Case, and Worst Case** scenarios to understand profitability and risk.
## Business Objective
* Understand sales and margin behavior under different demand scenarios
* Measure the impact of discounts and COGS on profitability
* Compare gross margin against a predefined target
* Support business decision-making using what-if analysis
## Key Assumptions
* Fixed discount percentage applied across scenarios
* COGS calculated as a percentage of net sales
* Average Net Invoice Price (NIP) remains constant
* Gross Margin target used as a benchmark
## Scenarios Covered
| Scenario       | Sales Units |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Best Case      | 100,000     |
| Realistic Case | 50,000      |
| Worst Case     | 25,000      |
## Metrics Calculated
